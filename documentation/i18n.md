# i18n

Other languages are supported by the i18n ini files in the `lib/i18n` folder.
It uses the two char lang code as a filename.

To add a new translation copy the existing `en.ini` file and rename it to the new language.
Edit every value for each key in the file. 
Get in touch or even make a PR via github to get the new language added.
